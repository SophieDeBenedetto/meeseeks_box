You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel? [Cornvelious Daniel is squealing with arousal] Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?\nCornvelious Daniel: It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun.\nRick: Yeah, well, tough titties. [the restaurant starts crumbling around Cornvelious Daniel and Rick]\nCornvelious Daniel: There's no tougher titty than a psychotic break, Rick.\nRick: Well, that depends on who breaks first—me or the titty.\n"},

And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.\nMorty: Okay, take it easy, Rick! Th-that's dark.\nRick: Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different? No more dad, Morty.\nMorty: Oh, geez...\nRick: He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away!\nMorty: Ohh, fuck! [backs away, trips and falls down]\nRick: I've replehh-ced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. I just took over the family, Morty! And if you tell your mom or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it, and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty! And now you're gonna have to go and do whatever I say, Morty! Forever!

Look it up.\nMorty: You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means.\nSummer: That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carp'en all them 'diems.\nRick: Listen to your sister Morty; to live is to risk it all; otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there, how much of that did you hear?\nJerry: All of it - you were looking right at me. [sighs] I just -- wanted to say goodbye to the kids.\nRick: Cool. Just stay in the driveway; the kill-bots are live, and I took you off the whitelist."},

[Morty holds a screwdriver] You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. [Morty turns pickle over with Rick's face on it] I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal! I'm a pickle! What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro? I turned myself into a pickle, Morty.\nMorty: And?\nRick: 'And'?

And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind [belch] we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle...when I feel like it.\nDr. Wong: Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."},

You fell into a vat of redundancy?\nNoob Noob: Haha god-damn!\nSupernova: Noob Noob, we're having a briefing. If I can continue Rick? I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I can trust you can be of service there?\nRick: Well let me check my list of powers and weaknesses: ability to do anything, but only whenever I want. Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.\nAlan Rails: I wish he had the ability to check his attitude.\nRick: Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains.

I see it everywhere I go. I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys we're all the same because they're threatened by what makes us unique. I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so we're too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice. I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss's salary even though they're identical and have the same IQ. The Citadel's problem isn't homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks, the Citadel's problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadel's death.

When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And I've never met a universe that was into it. The universe is basically an animal, it grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots, just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy.\nBeth: Tommy.\nRick: Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it'll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. There's no other way off.\nBeth: Dad, I'm out of excuses to not be who I am. So who am I? What do I do?\nRick: My advice... Take off. Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out.\nBeth: I can't do that. The kids, Jerry, my job, and, as much as I hate to admit it, ABC's The Bachelor.\nRick: I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you, with all your memories. An exact copy in every way. It'll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clone's job is done. It feels no pain, it regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going Blade Runner.\nBeth: If nothing matters, why would you do that for me?\nRick: I don't know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.\nBeth: I don't know if I can do it.\nRick: Then stay, and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen.
